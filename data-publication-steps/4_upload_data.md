# 4. Upload data 

The next step in the publication process is to upload your data to the platform where it will be hosted. This section will cover uploading data to the [CT Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/){:target="_blank"} and the [CT Geodata Portal](https://geodata.ct.gov/){:target="_blank"}. 

* Ensure that all publishers and reviewers have accounts on the platform where the data will be hosted. The person who will be responsible for uploading and maintaining the data will need access to an account with publishing rights. All reviewers and contributors will also need accounts to review private datasets before they are finalized and made public. To request access to the CT Open Data Portal or the CT Geodata Portal, contact the Open Data Coordinator or the GIS Coordinator at [dapa@ct.gov](mailto:dapa@ct.gov). 
* Log into the platform (either the CT Open Data Portal or the CT Geodata Portal) and create a new dataset. Detailed instructions for creating a new dataset on the CT Open Data Portal are available here.
* Upload the dataset and enter the metadata you have developed, including both the metadata about the dataset and the column metadata. 
* Publish the dataset as private and share the link with reviewers. Don’t make the dataset public until it has been reviewed internally.
