# 6. Update and maintain your data 

Once you have published your data as open data, it’s important to keep the data updated according to the update frequency indicated in the metadata. 

On the CT Open Data Portal, whether or not the dataset is up-to-date is calculated based on the update frequency in the metadata and is included in the dataset of [Public assets on data.ct.gov](https://data.ct.gov/Government/Public-assets-on-data-ct-gov/3pxu-4d3n){:target="_blank"}. 

On the CT Open Data Portal and the CT Geodata Portal, updates to data can be made manually through the user interface of the platform or they can be automated so the data is updated programmatically on a regular basis. 

If a dataset is updated more frequently than quarterly, we recommend automating the data updates rather than updating the data manually.
