# 3. Create metadata 

The next step in preparing your data for publication is to draft the metadata. Metadata is the data that describes other data. It helps answer the question “what is this data about?” 

High-quality metadata provides helpful context about the data’s creation, quality, and uses and is key to improving data discovery.

When publishing data as open data use the checklist below to make sure your metadata is complete.

- [ ] Does it include a **clear title** that non-technical users will be able to understand?
- [ ] Does the metadata describe **what information is contained** in the data?
- [ ] Does it include the **source of the data** and describe how the dataset was created?
- [ ] Does it list the **data owner** and provide a way for users to contact the data owner with questions?
- [ ] Does it include information about **how frequently the data is updated**?
- [ ] Does it provide guidance on **how the data should be used and any limitations**?
- [ ] Does it align with the **metadata standard** of the platform where the data is being published? See the Metadata Standard section for detailed guidance about the CT Open Data Portal and the CT Geodata Portal.
- [ ] Does it use **plain language** and avoid use of overly technical language, jargon, and acronyms?
- [ ] Is your language about people **person-centered**? When referring to a person or group of people, start with the person, not the characteristic. For instance, “person who is incarcerated” rather than “inmate.”
