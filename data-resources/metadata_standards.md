# Metadata standards 

This section provides guidance on metadata for publishers of open data in Connecticut state government, including through the [CT Open Data Portal](https://data.ct.gov/){:target="_blank"} and the [CT Geodata Portal](https://geodata.ct.gov/){:target="_blank"}. 

Metadata is the data that describes other data. It helps answer the question “what is this data about?” High quality metadata provides helpful context about the data’s creation, quality, and uses and is key to improving data discovery.

## Metadata Checklist 

When publishing data as open data use the checklist below to make sure your metadata is complete.

* Does the metadata describe **what information is contained** in the data? 
* Does it include a **clear title** that non-technical users will be able to understand? 
* Does it use **plain language** and avoid use of overly technical language, jargon, and acronyms? 
* Does it include the **source of the data** and describe how the dataset was created? 
* Does it list the **data owner**?
* Does it include information about **how frequently the data is updated**? 
* Does it provide guidance on **how the data should be used and any limitations**? 
* Does it align with the **metadata standard** of the platform where the data is being published? 

## CT Open Data Portal Metadata Schema

The table below summarizes the metadata element on the CT Open Data Portal. When creating a new dataset, data publishers should provide as much detail as possible in the metadata, providing the following elements where applicable. A more detailed version of the table below is available as an Excel spreadsheet [here](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/CT-Data/Metadata-Standard_2022.xlsx).

### Column Metadata

In addition to the dataset metadata (as detailed in the table above), data publishers should also provide “column metadata,” or descriptions of the columns in the dataset. Especially when column names are not easily understood by users not familiar with the dataset, data publishers should provide short column descriptions in the metadata. Additional technical documentation can be provided as an attachment accompanying the dataset.

## CT Geodata Portal Metadata Schema

The table below summarizes the metadata element on the CT Geodata Portal, adapted from the [ArcGIS Hub documentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/hub/content/prepare-your-content.htm){:target="_blank"}. Data publishers should provide as much detail as possible in the metadata, providing the following elements where applicable.

## Marking Data as Authoritative

In addition to providing complete metadata, publishers of data on the CT Geospatial Data Portal can also improve the usability of the data on the Portal by marking their data as authoritative. Designating items as authoritative makes it easier for users to find authoritative items. The ArcGIS Online documentation explains:

> Organization administrators and those with administrative privileges to update content can specify that an item is authoritative using the Mark as Authoritative button. Items designated as authoritative are identified with an Authoritative badge on the Overview tab. If your organization is verified, items that are shared with everyone (the public) and marked as authoritative display the organization name as the item owner on the Overview tab.
