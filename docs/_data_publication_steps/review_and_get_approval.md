# 5. Review and get approval 

After publishing your dataset as private, the next step is sharing it with anybody on your team that needs to review it before it is made public. 

Ask your colleagues to review the data as well as the metadata to make sure the data is presented clearly and accurately. 

You can also ask the Open Data Coordinator or GIS Coordinator to review your dataset to ensure that it is set up in a way that works well for users of the platform. 

Once you have incorporated any feedback from your reviewers, change the visibility settings of the data from private to public. Now your dataset will be visible to the public.

Now that you have published your data to the CT Open Data Portal or the CT Geodata Portal, you may want to let your stakeholders know. You can also let other open data users in the state know by posting to the [Open Data channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aby3J-Sxn821cmhl_aTjmxUfRlz90F7Nzhn20G9zqDOA1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=620a4f72-4ad4-43ce-93a4-0079cb317718&tenantId=118b7cfa-a3dd-48b9-b026-31ff69bb738b){:target="_blank"} in Teams.
