# Frequently asked questions 

**What is open data?**

Open data is data that can be freely used, reused, and redistributed without legal or financial restrictions. A more detailed definition is included in the [Connecticut General Statutes Sec. 4-67p](https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_050.htm#sec_4-67p){:target="_blank"}).

**How can I get started on the Open Data Portal?**

Get familiar with the Open Data Portal--Browse the Open Data Portal to get familiar with how it's set up. Check out the homepage, the data catalog, a dataset, and a data story to get a sense of the types of content published on the Portal. 

Request an account--Determine how you will be using the Open Data Portal. To review datasets, metadata, or data stories? To publish or update datasets? To manage automated data updates? Contact a site administrator by emailing [dapa@ct.gov](mailto:dapa@ct.gov) to request an account on the Portal. 

**What data should I publish on the Open Data Portal?** 

Agencies can use the Open Data Portal to make data from their programs available as open data. Data should:

* Belong to your agency;
* Have no fees for access, use, or adaptation;
* Be free from legal, contract, or policy restrictions;
* Have a plan for predictable and regular updates; and
* Not violate the privacy of individuals represented in the data. 

It's a good idea to consider datasets that are:

* Subject to disclosure through right-to-know, freedom of information, and/or public records laws;
* Shared with other agencies for operational purposes; 
* Used for reports on federal, state, or nonprofit grants; 
* Used by your agency for trend, statistical, or performance analysis; 
* Frequently requested by the public or other government agencies; or
* Considered high impact and high value by your agency, partner agencies, the public, and other stakeholders, especially if that data is not already publicly available in a machine-readable format.

For more guidance on what to publish see the [Identify Data to Publish](data-publication-steps\1_identify_data_to_publish) section of the handbook.

**How can I make a data story?** 

Data stories are pages on the CT Open Data Portal that highlight insights from open data through data, visualizations, and narrative. You can learn more about data stories in the [Data Stories](open-data-resources\data_stories) section of the handbook.
