This handbook is for Connecticut state employees who want to publish open data on the CT Open Data Portal and the CT Geodata Portal. 

## What is open data? 

Open data is data that is: 

* Freely available for download, indexing, and searching;
* Accessible in a machine-readable format; 
* Not limited by restrictions of use; 
* Published at the finest level of detail permitted by law; and 
* Described clearly in metadata so users can understand the context of the data, any limitations of use, and how to process the data (CGS Sec 4-67p).

## Open data roles

In Connecticut state government, agencies make their data available as open data on various platforms, including the CT Open Data Portal and the CT Geodata Portal. These platforms are administered by the Data and Policy Analytics unit in the Office of Policy and Management, in collaboration with data publishers across state agencies.

Some key roles associated with publishing data on the CT Open Data Portal and the CT Geodata Portal are: 

* Data steward. The data steward is the person at the agency with the most knowledge about the data who has the authority to make decisions about the data in their domain. They lead the preparation of the data and metadata for publication. 
* Data custodian. The data custodian is the person at the agency with the technical knowledge about how the data is stored and how it can be extracted. They support the access, extraction, and automation of the data. 
* Open data coordinator. The open data coordinator is part of the Data and Policy Analytics team in the Office of Policy and Management. They work with data stewards and data custodians at state agencies to coordinate the publication of data to the CT Open Data Portal. 
* GIS coordinator. The GIS coordinator is part of the GIS Office in the Office of Policy and Management. They work with data stewards and data custodians at state agencies to coordinate the publication of data to the CT Geodata Portal. 

## How to use this handbook
